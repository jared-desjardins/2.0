I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/), and my [research specialization](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/pages/3_research/) is in theoretical linguistics - particularly morphology, syntax, semantics, and their interface. I'm also interested in the relation between linguistics and computer science, specifically the use of computational tools for linguistic inquiry, and the application of linguistic theory in computational tasks. Outside of linguistics, I enjoy running and hiking, philosophy, music, and spending time with my dog. The picture to your right is of me taking a picture of a chipmunk at [Hanging Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Lake), and [__this__](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/img/chipmunk.jpg) is the picture of the chipmunk.
