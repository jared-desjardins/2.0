I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/), with the privilege of having [Dr. Laura Michaelis-Cummings](http://www.colorado.edu/faculty/michaelis/) as my doctoral adviser. My [research specialization](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/pages/3_research/) is in theoretical linguistics - particularly morphology, syntax, semantics, and [their interface](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/LI/). I'm also interested in the relation between linguistics and computer science, specifically the use of computational tools for linguistic inquiry, and the application of linguistic theory in computational tasks. Outside of linguistics, I enjoy running and hiking, philosophy (generally of the continental tradition, although I do appreciate the influence of the analytic movement on modern linguistics), music (in particular classical and romantic piano, [music composition](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/pages/5_music/), and the relationship between music, language, and cognition), and spending time with my dog.
