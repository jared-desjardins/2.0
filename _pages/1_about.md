I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/), with the privilege of being co-advised by [Dr. Laura Michaelis](http://www.colorado.edu/faculty/michaelis/) and [Dr. Mans Hulden](http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mahu0110/), and my [research specialization](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/pages/3_research/) is in theoretical linguistics - particularly morphology, syntax, semantics, and their interface. I'm also interested in the relationship between linguistics and computer science, specifically the use of computational tools in linguistic inquiry. Outside of academia, I enjoy running and hiking, philosophy, music, and spending time with my dog. The picture to your right is of me taking a picture of a chipmunk at [Hanging Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Lake), and [__this__](http://jared-desjardins.github.io/img/chipmunk.jpg) is the picture of the chipmunk.
