I'm fascinated by the complexity of human language, and my research is driven by a general curiosity about words, parts of words, the implicit rule systems that govern their various combinations, and how (and why) those combinations mean what they mean. Consequently, my research is primarily focused on **morphology**, **syntax**, **semantics**, and **their "interface"**, and I have explored each from a variety of perspectives, including language in interaction, frequency and grammaticalization, and formal theory (historically [Minimalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_program), but more recently within [construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_grammar)-based approaches), and I frequently utilize empirical, **corpus-based methods**.
