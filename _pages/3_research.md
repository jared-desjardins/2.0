I'm fascinated by the complexity of human language, and my research is driven by a general curiosity about words, parts of words, the implicit rule systems that govern their various combinations, and how (and why) those combinations mean what they mean. Consequently, my research is primarily concerned with **morphology**, **syntax**, **semantics**, and **their "interface"**, and I have explored each from a variety of approaches, including language in interaction, frequency and grammaticalization, and formal theory (specifically the [Minimalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_program), but more recently, and in my view correctly, within [construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_grammar)-based theories), and I frequently utilize empirical, corpus-based methods. Please see below for information about my current and past research projects, and feel free to contact me with any questions.
