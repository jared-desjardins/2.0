<h4>LING 4420 Morphology and Syntax</h4>
<sup>Instructor of Record | Spring 2018, Fall 2018</sup>  

This post-introductory course provides a survey of the fundamental elements of morphology - the principles of word formation - and syntax - the principles of sentence structure, covering major morphological and syntactic structures found among the world's languages. We will discuss methods for describing grammatical constructions, and frequently use in-class data analysis as the backbone for our discussions. While this course adopts a typological perspective, we will briefly touch on major theoretical accounts of morphology and syntax, and their relationship to cognitive-functional linguistics. Prerequisite: LING 2000 Introduction to Linguistics.

<h4>LING 1020 Languages of the World</h4>
<sup>Instructor of Record | Spring 2015-2017, Fall 2015-2016</sup>  

This introductory course explores the diversity of human language through the lens of a linguist. We will explore the similarities and differences of world languages across four linguistic domains: what the language sounds like (Phonology), its words and how they're created (Morphology), how sentences are created (Syntax), and meaning (Semantics). A few of the major topics we will discuss include the various language families across the globe, how linguists determine which languages are related and which aren't, and how languages differ, are similar, and influence one another, involving the analysis and discussion of data from various languages. Finally, we will close the semester by exploring the effects of language contact and language death, preservation, and revitalization. [Graduate Teaching Assistant | Spring 2013; Fall 2013, 2017]
