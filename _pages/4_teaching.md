<h4>LING 4420 Morphology and Syntax</h4>
<sup>Instructor of Record | Spring 2018, Fall 2018</sup>  

This post-introductory course provides a survey of the fundamental elements of morphology - the principles of word formation - and syntax - the principles of sentence structure, covering major morphological and syntactic structures found among the world's languages. We will discuss methods for describing grammatical constructions, and frequently use in-class data analysis as the backbone for our discussions. While this course adopts a typological perspective, we will briefly touch on major theoretical accounts of morphology and syntax, and their relationship to cognitive-functional linguistics. Prerequisite: LING 2000 Introduction to Linguistics.

<h4>LING 1020 Languages of the World</h4>
<sup>Instructor of Record | Spring 2015-2017, Fall 2015-2016</sup>  

This introductory course explores the diversity of human language through the lens of a linguist. We will explore the similarities and differences of world languages across four linguistic domains: what the language sounds like (Phonology), its words and how they're created (Morphology), how sentences are created (Syntax), and meaning (Semantics). A few of the major topics we will discuss include the various language families across the globe, how linguists determine which languages are related and which aren't, and how languages differ, are similar, and influence one another, involving the analysis and discussion of data from various languages. Finally, we will close the semester by exploring the effects of language contact and language death, preservation, and revitalization. [Graduate Teaching Assistant | Spring 2013; Fall 2013, 2017]

<h4>LING/CLAS 1010 The Study of Words</h4>
<sup>Graduate Teaching Assistant | Spring 2014</sup>  

Study of English words of Latin and Greek origin, focusing on etymological meaning by analysis of component parts (prefixes, bases, suffixes) and on the ways in which words have changed and developed semantically. (2018-2019 Course Catalog, University of Colorado Boulder)

<h4>LING 1000 Language in US Society</h4>
<sup>Graduate Teaching Assistant | Fall 2014</sup>  

This course is a non-technical, entry-level exploration to the relationship of language and society in the United States. First, we will explore the perceptions and realities of the varieties of American English, including Chicano English, African American Vernacular English, Southern English, Boston English, New York English, Cajun, Texan, Pittsburghese, Midwest, and many more. The second half of the course explores various issues associated with the multilingual nature of U.S. society: the maintenance and loss of heritage languages and Native American languages, bilingual education, the social histories of American Sign Language, American ‘creole’ languages, accent-based discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, we will briefly explore the impact of language in the media. No prior study of Linguistics is required, but all students are expected to explore the idea that language is a crucial cultural resource for communities. Throughout, students will observe, discuss, and analyze the language in everyday American life.

<h4>LING 7800/CSCI 7000 Computational Lexical Semantics</h4>
<sup>Grader | Fall 2014; Spring 2016, 2017</sup>  

Lexical semantics is becoming an increasingly important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as the field is beginning to address semantics at a large scale. This introductory lecture course will cover key issues in computational lexical semantics. We will start with an introduction to theoretical models of lexical semantics and events, considering both their adequacy as linguistic models and their place in NLP. We will focus particularly on computational lexical resources such as PropBank, VerbNet and the Generative Lexicon, and examine their strengths and limitations with respect to NLP applications. We will introduce apporoaches to developing automatic classifiers that are intended to make use of these resources and to offer richer representations of sentences in context. These techniques can be fully supervised (requiring hand-labeled training data), semi-supervised, or unsupervised (learning lexical information from unlabeled text). Several lectures will be shared with a parallel C[omputer] S[science] course on Computational Semantics being run by Professor James Pustejovsky at Brandeis University, who will avail us of his expertise in semantics, especially with respect to the Generative Lexicon and Event Representations. (Fall 2014, LING 7800/CSCI 7000 Syllabus, Dr. Martha Palmer)

<h4>LING 5430 Semantics and Pragmatics</h4>
<sup>Grader | Spring 2018</sup>  

Semantic analysis reveals the human capacity to construe experience flexibly (e.g., by understanding emotion as a substance, a location or a force). Such flexibility is critical to our reasoning and our communicative ability. In this class, we will explore the cognitive faculties that enable people to describe scenes, understand other people’s communicative intentions and choose appropriate language forms. Our exploration will require us to look closely and critically at a wide variety of theories that have been used to describe these faculties. These theories describe conventions about what words mean in combination with other words (semantic theories) and conventional linguistic strategies, including inferential strategies (pragmatic theories). During this exploration, we will learn to use linguistic data (language deployed in context) to make our own generalizations about the nature of the linguistic blueprint that we use to construct meaning. (Spring 2018, LING 5430 Syllabus, Dr. Laura Michaelis)
