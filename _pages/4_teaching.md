This post-introductory course provides a survey of the fundamental elements of morphology - the principles of word formation - and syntax - the principles of sentence structure, covering major morphological and syntactic structures found among the world's languages. We will discuss methods for describing grammatical constructions, and frequently use in-class data analysis as the backbone for our discussions. While this course adopts a typological perspective, we will briefly touch on major theoretical accounts of morphology and syntax, and their relationship to cognitive-functional linguistics. Prerequisite: LING 2000 Introduction to Linguistics.
