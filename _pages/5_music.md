Music has always been interesting to me - I've been playing piano for over twenty five years, and composing music for almost two decades. I also studied (pitched) percussion for nearly ten years, and have participated in various jazz, wind, and orchestral ensembles between middle school and early college.

In terms of piano, my favorite periods are the late classical and romantic, with Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin being some of my favorite composers spanning those eras. 

I think an accurate descriptor of my own music is it tends to be minor, and I particularly like experimenting with melody and melodic structures, traditional orchestration, synthesized instrumentation, among other things. I'm pretty sure my music is deeply influenced by Western art composers (some of whom are listed above), soundtrack composers (e.g., Hans Zimmer), (musically) contemporary artists (e.g., David Bowie, Simon and Garfunkel), and [Philip Glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass).
