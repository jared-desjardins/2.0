Music has always been an important part of my life; I've been playing piano for over twenty five years, and composing music for almost two decades. I also studied percussion for nearly ten years, mostly specializing in pitched percussion and timpani, and have participated in various jazz, wind, and orchestral ensembles between middle school and early college. Over the years, I've also learned pipe organ, clarinet, classical guitar, and mountain dulcimer to varying degrees, although admittedly in limited capacities.

In terms of piano, my favorite periods are the late classical and romantic, with Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin being some of my favorite composers spanning those eras. 

My own music is quite eclectic, although most of what I write is in minor. I enjoy experimenting with melody, traditional orchestration, synthesized instrumentation, percussion (or lack thereof), assumptions associated with certain sounds and sound sequences, among other things. My music is (and has been) influenced by Western art composers (some of whom are listed above), soundtrack composers (specifically Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, and Clint Mansell), contemporary musicians (e.g. David Bowie, Simon and Garfunkel, John Denver, MUSE, etc.), and Philip Glass.

<h4>Storm's Overture and Earlier Work</h4>
<sup>1999 - 2008</sup>  
<p>I think I remember coming up with what I would consider a proper melody in fifth grade, so about 11 years old or so. But I didn't seriously begin writing music until sixth or seventh grade, when I won a small music-writing competition among my middle school band, and my band director (the late <a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/jacksoncochronicle/lifestyles/larry-busching-reflects-on-the-magic-at-melrose-mindoro/article_b7a1e05c-a55f-589b-8fbb-ea2befda2b30.html">Mr. Busching</a>) gave me a copy of the music notation software Finale 2007. I composed my first piece of music - <i>Storm's Overture</i>, for chamber orchestra - the summer before my freshman year of high school, and shortly after starting high school I was given a small book on orchestration, which I used to transcribe <i>Storm's Overture</i> for wind symphony (subsequently played by the University of Wisconsin La Crosse Wind Ensemble that winter). Throughout high school and early college I continued to write music for piano and various symphonic arrangements, predominantly using Finale 2007 and 2008; some of these later pieces are provided above, grouped under the title <i>Fragmenta</i>, although most are unfortunately lost forever.</p>
