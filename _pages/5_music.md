Music has always been an important part of my life; I've been playing piano for over twenty five years, and composing music for almost two decades. I also studied percussion for nearly ten years, mostly specializing in pitched percussion and timpani, and have participated in various jazz, wind, and orchestral ensembles between middle school and early college. Over the years, I've also learned pipe organ, clarinet, classical guitar, and mountain dulcimer to varying degrees, although admittedly in limited capacities.

In terms of piano, my favorite periods are the late classical and romantic, with Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin being some of my favorite composers spanning those eras. 

My own music is quite eclectic, although most of what I write is in minor. I enjoy experimenting with melody, traditional orchestration, synthesized instrumentation, percussion (or lack thereof), assumptions associated with certain sounds and sound sequences, among other things. My music is (and has been) influenced by Western art composers (some of whom are listed above), soundtrack composers (specifically Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, and Clint Mansell), contemporary musicians (e.g. David Bowie, Simon and Garfunkel, John Denver, MUSE, etc.), and Philip Glass.
