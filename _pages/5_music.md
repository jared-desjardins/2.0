<h4>Storm's Overture and Earlier Work</h4>
<sup>1999 - 2008</sup>  
<p>I think I remember coming up with what I would consider a proper melody in fifth grade, so about 11 years old or so. But I didn't seriously begin writing music until sixth or seventh grade, when I won a small music-writing competition among my middle school band, and my band director (the late <a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/jacksoncochronicle/lifestyles/larry-busching-reflects-on-the-magic-at-melrose-mindoro/article_b7a1e05c-a55f-589b-8fbb-ea2befda2b30.html">Mr. Busching</a>) gave me a copy of the music notation software Finale 2007. I composed my first piece of music - <i>Storm's Overture</i>, for chamber orchestra - the summer before my freshman year of high school, and shortly after starting high school I was given a small book on orchestration, which I used to transcribe <i>Storm's Overture</i> for wind symphony (subsequently played by the University of Wisconsin La Crosse Wind Ensemble that winter). Throughout high school and early college I continued to write music for piano and various symphonic arrangements, predominantly using Finale 2007 and 2008; some of these later pieces are provided above, grouped under the title <i>Fragmenta</i>, although most are unfortunately lost forever.</p>
