# **THE THEORETICAL SETTING & SOA** (Desjardins 2020a:12-15)


## Chomsky (1964:24) sets the “goals of linguistic theory”, in terms of the Humboldtian (1988L91) views: (i) “the instrumental function of language is derivative”, and (ii) “it is the underlying form of language as a system of generative rules that defines the roles of each element”; assumes a “fundamental distinction” between rule-governed creativity (regular and recursive syntactic processes) and rule-changing creativity (e.g. analogic change) (1964:20-22) (Desjardins 2020a:12-13)

### Chomsky (1964: 26) frames linguistic theory as concerned with two abstract devices A and B; using ‘primary linguistic data’ as input, and “utilize[ing] its given faculté de langage [language faculty], its innate specification of certain heuristic procedures and certain built-in constraints” (ibid.), the learning model B produces a generative grammar as output. The perceptual device A, using the internalized grammar produced by B, provides a complete structural description and phonological representation to a given utterance in the linguistic system (langue) (Desjardins 2020a:13)

- The overall setting and scope of  (generative) linguistic theory had two important effects: (i) linguistic theory is now primarily concerned with understanding a device (the language faculty) which, using primary linguistic data, produces a generative grammar well suited for understanding and producing recursive and regular syntactic phenomena; and, (ii) grammar becomes a method (a “**HYPOTHESIS**” (Chomsky 2009[1966]:118, note 2) for identifying what information is necessary for understanding (and positively generating) a given utterance based on the structural description of the generative grammar in (i). (Desjardins 2020a: 14)

	- Specifically concerning the syntacticized notion of the language faculty and a structurally compositional viewpoint, when specific distributional patterns of English synthetic word forms were considered the most straightforward solution was the lexicalist position (Chomsky 1970: 188): **a distinct word formation component preceding syntax**. It is this culmination of a distinct word formation component (i.e. **MORPHOLOGY**), the original lexicalist proposal defining its relation to syntax, and inherent theoretical positions underlying the initial formulation(s) of each that Bresnan & Mchombo (1995: 181) refer to as a fundamental generalization [of LI] traditionally maintained by morphologists (and syntacticians) (Desjardins 2020a:15)

### Chomsky (1964: 21-22), citing Whitney (1874: 372), assumes the view initiated by the nineteenth century Structural Linguistics of Saussure (1972[1916]) that “language in the concrete sense … [is] … the sum of words and phrases by which any [person] expresses […] thought” (Desjardins 2020a:13)

### Chomsky (2009[1966]:65) redefines linguistic creativity from a ‘Cartesian’ point of view, framing this fundamental creative aspect of human language in terms of “a species-specific capacity [...]” associating the underlying generative processes of underlying form with linguistic competence – the possession of knowledge (a mental faculty), as distinct from performance (the use of such linguistic knowledge) (2009[1966]:75)

# ***MODELS, FRAMEWORKS, THEORIES***


# **CONTINUATION OF THE MINIMAL FRAMEWORK** (Desjardins 2020b:20-23)


## **The Standard Theory of Transformational Grammar** (Chomsky 1957, 1965)

### **(1)** general linguistic theory is defined (Chomsky 1964:25-27) in terms of an attempt to character device B (the learning model and language faculty) and a generative grammar G as “an attempt to specify the information [...] available to A [perceptual model] that makes it capable of understanding an arbitrary utterance [U] to the highly non-trivial extent that understanding is determined by the structural description [D] provided by the generative grammar [G]” (Chomsky 1964:26) (Desjardins 2020b:20)

### (2) the language faculty is understood in terms of “pessission of [linguistic] knowledge”, competence (Chomsky 1965:4, 1966:75) (Desjardins 2020b:20)

### (3) a (generative) grammar is assumed to be a “description of the tactic competence [language faculty] of the speaker hearer that underlies [their] actual performance [...] specify[ing] a pairing of phonetic and semantic representations [i.e. structural descriptions D] over an infinite range” (Chomsky 1966:118, Note 2) (Desjardins 2020b:20)

### **The Minimal Framework** (Chomsky 1968, 1972:123-124)

- G → K = {Σ : Σ = (P1, …, Pn)}

	- Related theoretical assumptions (Chomsky 1972:130): (a) “What is the relation of the lexical to the nonlexical transformations?; what is the nature of the lexical items and the lexical transformations?”; (b)	“How is Σ of [(21)] related to a representation of the meaning of the sentence in question, and what is the character of semantic representation and the rules that relate it to Σ (if any)?”; (c) “Are there any further conditions on Κ of [(21)] in addition to those cited? […]”

	- G of the minimal framework consists of (i) a lexicon and lexical entries, each specifying phonological, semantic, and syntactic properties of some lexical item [word] (Chomsky 1968:68:64); (ii) general principles and constraints belonging to universal grammar (Chomsky 1972:124); (iii) system of transformations specifying class K of syntactic structures (1958:63) and relating each member of K to a phonetic and semantic representation (1968:64) (Desjardins 2020b:20-21)

	- K = infinity class of finite sequences of phrase markers, with each post-lexical structure of a particular phrase marker sequence determined by a transformation T of G, and Pn representing “‘surface structure’, [which] determines the phonetic form of the sentence generated by the phonological rules” (Chomsky 1972:124)

- **The Extended Standard Theory** 

	- “The standard theory is inadequate and must be modified to the EXTENDED STANDARD THEORY” (Chomsky 1972:136) = retains the MINIMAL FRAMEWORK + assumptions (a) [**EXPANDED LEXICON**] and (c), modifies (b) so LF/semantic interpretation takes both base-generated D-structures and S-structures into account (cf. Chomsky 1972:134) (Desjardins 2020b:21)

	- **(1')** Chomsky (1973:232) **fundamental problem of linguistics**: an attempt to explain how one acquires knowledge of language; **knowledge** “expressed in the form of a system of rules (a grammar [G]) that generates the language [K]” (ibid.) (cf. device B (the learning model), and the minimal framework), and **language** construed as the “set of structural descriptions of sentences, where a full structural description determines (in particular) the sound and meaning of a linguistic expression” (ibid.) (cf. device A, the perceptual model) (Desjardins 2020b:21)

	- In order to approach (1'), Chomsky (1973) sets conditions (comprising UG) on the function of grammar (how grammatical rules work to generate structural descriptions) and the form of grammar (the systems claimed to qualify as grammars)

		- **FUNCTION OF GRAMMAR:** strictly generative (i.e. derivational) and intertwined with one’s innate *language faculty* (linguistic knowledge, competence, or underlying form) “as a system of generative rules that defines the role of each element [i.e. WORD]” (Chomsky 1964:24)

		- **FORM OF GRAMMAR:** Chomsky (1973:233) “presuppose[s] […] without further discussion, a set of additional conditions on the form of grammar constituting […] the [EST]” (see also Chomsky 1981:4)

	- **Government & Binding, Principles & Parameters, Universal Grammar...**

		- Chomsky (1981:4-5) organizes (universal) grammar in terms of **a series of interacting subsystems, each consisting of distinct principles and parameters:**

			- the lexicon and categorial syntactic component “generate D-structures […] through insertion of lexical items into structures generated by [the categorial component], in accordance with their feature structure” (1981:5) (Desjardins 2020b:21)

			- Each D-structure is mapped to a S-structure by the rule move-α (part of the transformational component, and possibly PF and LF), “leaving traces [of words] coindexed with their antecedents; […] thus the syntax generates S-structures which are assigned PF- and LF-representations” (ibid.) by each subsequent interpretive (PF and LF) component (Desjardins 2020b:21)


# “It is reasonable to regard **the grammar of a language** ***L*** ideally as a mechanism that provides an enumeration of the sentences of *L* in something like the way in which a deductive theory gives an enumeration of a set of theorems. […] Furthermore, **the theory of language can be regarded as a study of the formal properties of such grammars**, and, with a precise enough formulation, this general theory can provide a uniform method for determining, from the process of generation of a given sentence, **a structural description** which can give a good deal of insight into how this sentence is used and understood [ibid.].” (Chomsky 1959:55-56) (Desjardins 2020a:14, f.n. 16)

# “access violations may be characterized as syntactic ***forms*** and associated ***functions*** requiring access to specific sublexical ***forms*** (and ***function***(s), assuming form–function isomorphism (Chomsky 1964: 24)). Similar to manipulation violations, languages with higher degrees of semantic density per grammatical marker, and more synthetic typological profiles, tend to utilize morphological (e.g. affixation) and lexical (e.g. suppletion) means for expressing linguistic content. Considering that a **highly semantically dense word form** simultaneously expresses multiple conceptual categories, any of which may be relevant to syntactic combination, **syntax** (and a distinct semantics) accordingly require access to specific (syntactically relevant, word-internal) information (and vice versa). Access violations therefore present similar, though obviously more semantically oriented, challenges to models of grammar assuming maximally distinct **morphological** and **syntactic components** and related strong forms of LI.” (Desjardins 2020a:17)


# “since morphologically complex languages tend to form ‘**words**’ in terms of linear sequences of bound morphemes (***form***), and each morpheme and/or word might encode multiple semantic concepts (***function***) which may or may not bear syntactic relevancy, apparent instances of syntactic manipulation (word-part ellipsis and movement) may be observed. Thus examples of apparent syntactic manipulation of **morphology** and their typological realities raise questions for the part of strong LI that predicts that syntactic processes (e.g. movement, deletion, etc.) cannot affect a proper subpart of a word, and relatedly, for models of grammar which position word formation prior to (or maximally distinct from) syntax.” (Desjardins 2020a:17)


# “order violations are associated with specific analytic and synthetic tendencies within each typological profile, with word-level order violations most closely, related to strictly **synthetic word-formation** [...] languages presenting analytic tendencies also exhibit phrase-level order violations, where **syntax appears to serve as the input to word formation**. Given such languages tend to rely on syntax (construed as the ‘input’ in this inverse ordering relationship) for linguistic expression to a greater degree than morphologically complex languages, it follows that in certain cases **the predominant system for grammatical expression would appear to be extended into the traditional domain of word formation**. Furthermore, since phrase-level order violations are attested across **all typological** ***forms*** exhibiting **low-to-high degrees of semantic density**, situations of inflectional and/or derivational morphology appearing on phrases (or zero derived phrasal compounds) could be viewed as a blurring of morphosyntactic ***form*** and ***function*** (conceived of here as order (and possibly also manipulation) violations) that is more commonly considered the purview of diachronic linguistics (e.g. grammaticalization and lexicalization processes whereby phrases become words, and historically independent linguistic units become affix-like).” (Desjardins 2020a:18)


# **GROUP D** [*type (33a) mixed -- non-lexicalist -- derivational*] theories thus maintain the very same MINIMAL FRAMEWORK of early TG and the ST, specifically: the lexicon (Chomsky 1968) and EXPANDED LEXICON after Chomsky (1970); a construal of UG (Chomsky 1972) consisting of conditions on the FORM + FUNCTION OF GRAMMAR (Chomsky 1973); and, while no longer ‘transformational’, a strictly DERIVATIONAL system of X-bar rules (with respect to GB/P&P) and operations merge and move (with respect to MP) which specify the infinite class K of syntactic structures (1968), i.e. language (1973) (Desjardins 2020b:21-22).


# Disagree with Marantz (1997) that “the grammatical architecture that led to lexicalism is no longer practiced, so the concersnare no loneger relevant” (Siddiqi 2019:146), and that the MODEL and FRAMEWORK we are led to is a fully syntactic, derivational one. I consider the same MINIMAL/GENERAL FRAMEWORK noted by Chomsky (1968:64, 1972:130) and subsequent EST/GB (Chomsky 1970, 1981) view of syntax, lexicon, and grammar, to underly present non-lexcialist alternatives (Desjardins 2020b:20)


# “Considering Chomsky’s emphasis on recursion and regular syntactic processes, the form(s) and function(s) associated with (generative) linguistic theory have been considered from a distinctly analytic typological perspective, presenting inherent challenges to synthetic and periphrastic types of linguistic expression” (Desjardins 2020a:16)


## Given each violation type (Section 2) is identifiable by the very instances of morphosyntactic form–function interaction that LI is intended to restrict, and each violation (sub)type is related to particular synthetic and/or analytic typological traits (Section 3), it seems most reasonable to consider ‘morphology’, ‘syntax’, and their ‘interface’ in terms of a holistic, highly structured network of linguistic signs. 


# ***COURS DE LINGUISTIQUE GÉNÉRALE***  (Saussure 1972[1916])


## ***language*** =  

### **(a) a well-defined entity that can be “localised in that particular section of the speech circuit where sound patterns are associated with concepts”** (Saussure 1972: 31), defining language to be a system of relations between linguistic forms and functions (i.e. ***signs*** (Saussure 1972[1916]:98, Sag 2012: 70-71))

### **(b) a system of synchronically interdependent parts** (1972: 124) that can be studied independently (***langue***, as distinguished from *parole* (speech)) (1972: 31) 


# **THEORIES, MODELS, DATA** (Lyons 1977:25-31)


## 1.6 introduce a set of terminological conventions by means of which we can **clearly distinguish between the observable phenomena and a variety of theoretical constructions** (pp. 25-26)

### (a) language-behaviour [parole, performance] vs. **language-system** [langue, competence]; use of pre-theoretical terms ‘meaning’ and ‘WORD’, intuitive (p. 27), and observational terms (p. 28); **model of the regularities manifest in language-behaviour, a model of the language-system** (p. 29)

### (b) **distinction between the underlying language-system and the linguist’s model of the language-system** (p. 29); distinction not maintained by Chomsky (1965:25), uses ‘GRAMMAR’ to refer both to the speaker’s competence and the linguist’s model of that competence (f.n. 17)

### (c) distinguish between uttered sentences (of parole, performance, behavior) and **sentences as abstract, theoretical entities** in the model of the language-system, system sentences are sequences of WORDS (p. 29-30)


# **FORMS, LEXEMES, EXPRESSIONS** (Lyons 1977:13-25)


## **1.5 Three-fold distinction** between (i) forms, (ii) lexemes, and (iii) expressions

### (i) definition of **(word) forms** based on text (p. 18); may be (morphologically) complex or simple (p. 21), in accordance with Bloomfield (1926) and Chomsky “forms are identified as tokens of the same type solely on the grounds of their form, independently of their meaning or their assignment to lexemes”

- *found* and *find* are **WORD-FORMS** of the lexeme ‘find’ (citation form) “find” (meaning)

- **Word-form TOKEN**: “unique physical entities in time/space” (p. 14)

- **Word-form TYPE**: generalize from any individual occurrence/single token to the class of all its tokens (p. 16); categorization of tokens into types based on pattern recognition, functional factors/conventional standards, concept formation (ibid.)

- Bloomfield’s (1926) principle “every utterance is wholly made up of forms (as every form is wholly made up of phonemes)” (p. 17)

### (ii) **lexemes** are abstract entities  and do not have a form, they are associated with a set of one or more forms (p. 22)

- The token-type distinction does not apply to **LEXEMES**, only to forms (p. 20)

- The distinction between FORMS and LEXEMES also applies to phrases - **PHRASAL-LEXEMES**, **WORD-LEXEMES** are a subclass of lexemes (p. 23)

### (iii) the term **expression**, a question of whether it’s necessary/convenient to distinguish all three terms (p. 23); assuming:

- **EXPRESSIONS** include certain linguistic units whose function is to refer (referring expressions), and certain linguistic units whose function is to be predicated, or predicable, of entities that are referred to, (predicative expressions) (p. 23)

- Expressions cannot be identified with forms; an underlying complex linguistic entity which determines form, and functions as a referring expression (p. 24)

- ***The relation between (iii) and (i) is similar, if not identical, to the relation between (ii) and (i)*** (p. 24-25)

### Cannot describe the relations that hold between (i) forms and (ii) lexemes, and between (ii) lexemes and (iii) expressions, except within the **FRAMEWORK** of some specific **GRAMMATICAL THEORY** (p. 25)


# **DESIGN FEATURES & LEVELS OF ANALYSIS** (Lyons 1977)


## Most linguists distinguish at least **three levels of structure in their analysis of sentences**: (1) phonological, (2) syntactic, (3) semantic; may/may not add **morphology** to serve as a bridge between (1) and (2) in particular languages (p. 373)

### The theoretical conclusion: **there is an intrinsic connection between the meaning of words and their distribution, thus difficult to draw boundary between (2) syntax and (3) semantics** (p. 375)

- “But it is always possible to draw a theoretical distinction between **MORPHOLOGY & (1) phonology**, and between **MORPHOLOGY & (2) syntax** (p. 376)

	- SYNTAX: a set of rules which accounts for the distribution of word-forms throughout the sentences of a language; presupposes each word-form is assigned to one or more form-classes (p. 376)

	- MORPHOLOGY: realizational, ‘runs’ (lexeme) --> [‘run’ : 3SgPrs] (morphosyntactic-word) --> *runs* (word-form)

## (ii) **Duality**: two levels of structural organization, phonological and grammatical (p. 72)

### The relation between the phonological and grammatical levels is complicated across languages: **basic units of grammatical analysis**, Isolating (words), Agglutinative (morphemes), Fusional (form-lexeme distinction (p. 72-73) 

- Distinguish third sense of **WORD** - morphosyntactic-words underlying (or realized by) word-forms; distinction between lexeme, morphosyntactic-word, word-form drawn to emphasize the relation between grammatical levels can be complex (pp. 73-74)


# **ABSTRACT ENTITIES** (Carnap 1950)


## E.g. **properties** designated by predicates, **propositions** designated by sentences (p. 21)

## Carnap shows that using/**accepting** a language/**framework** referring to **abstract entities** is compatible with empiricism and scientific thinking (p. 21)

### **Two steps in acceptance of a framework**: (1) introduction of a general term, a predicate of higher level, for the new kind of entities (e.g. *property*, *number*…); (2) introduction of variables of the new type – new entities are values (property, number) of these variables, the constants (red, five) are substitutable for the variables (p. 30)

- After the new forms are introduced into the language, it is possible to formulate **internal questions** (either empirical or logical) and possible answers (either factually true or analytic) (p. 31)

- Distinguish **external questions**: philosophical questions concerning the existence or reality of the framework itself… **it is the question of whether whether or not to accept the new linguistic forms**, *with acceptance judged as being more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended,* not as being either true or false because it is not an assertion (pp. 31-32)

## **4. Abstract Entities in Semantics (pp. 33-40)

### The question of the admissibility of entities of a certain type **or of abstract entities in general as designata** *is reduced to the question of the acceptability of those entities* [cf. **two steps in acceptance of a framework** above) (p. 35)

## 5. **Conclusion** (pp. 39-40)

### [1] the decisive question is not the alleged ontological question the existence of abstract entities but rather the question whether the use of abstract linguistic forms or, in technical terms, the use of variables beyond those for things (or phenomenal data), is expedient and fruitful for the purposes for which semantical analyses are made, viz. the analysis, interpretation, clarification, or construction of languages of communication, especially languages of science (p. 39)

### [2] The acceptance or rejection of abstract linguistic forms, just as the acceptance or rejection of any other linguistic forms in any branch of science, will finally be decided by their efficiency as instruments, the ratio of the results achieved to the amount and complexity of the efforts required (p. 40)
